# Ft_Printf, what to do next?


## Create libftprintf.a

- [X] Correct the Makefile that creates libftprintf.a so it builds libft.a too
- [X] Problems to rebuild project when update with make -C. What to do?

## Manage a conversion for example

- [X] Start by managing %i/%d with one int argument
- [X] Why not try %i/%d with more int argument

## Manage more conversions to the minimum

- [X] Let's try with another specifier: %c
- [ ] Let's try with another specifier: %u
- [ ] Let's try with another specifier: %%
- [ ] Let's try with another specifier: %s
- [ ] Let's try with another specifier: %x, %X
- [ ] Let's try with another specifier: %p

## Manage one flag for example

- [ ] Think about the general strategy to manage multiple flags
	- [ ] GO the 0b101010 route: bitshifting and bitwise operations... A flag 
	light up one positional candle in a short or an int
- [ ]

## Manage the rest basic printf flags

*Well, we're waiting*
